Revision history for Perl extension Math::Symbolic.

0.110  Sat Jul 19 15:16:11 2003
	- Documentation patches.
	- Added total derivatives.
	- Fixed the host of bugs that were discovered while implementing
	  total derivatives.
	- Added tests.
	- Added docs.
	- Added docs section on variable passing styles to Compiler.pm
	- Added implement()
	- Fixed uncovered bugs in total derivatives.
	- TODO goals met with this release:
		+ Add signatures to variables.
		+ Add signature() methods to all elements.
		+ Amend parser to parse signatures.
		+ Given the signature-parser enhancements, total derivatives
		  start making sense.
		  Since function signatures must be defined by their signatures
	 	  when they're used, total derivatives can be applied to all
		  functions. (Or, if their implementation is still undefined,
		  they can possibly still be kicked out because of their
		  non-dependence on a particular variable.)
		+ Add tests for sigs.
		+ Add tests for the new features.

0.108  Wed Jul 16 22:41:01 2003
	- Added Math::Symbolic::Compiler (as a modified to_sub.pl).
	- Modified value() semantics to optionally take arguments.

	- Added lots of docs.
	- Added some tests.
	- TODO milestones met with this release:

		  compile Math::Symbolic trees to subroutines and/or code.

0.107  Sun Jul 13 21:25:29 2003
	- Fixed tests. (Note to self: recreate MANIFEST for dists.)

0.106  Sun Jul 13 19:56:29 2003
	- Modified the parser to parse unknown identifiers as variables.
	- Modified Operator constructor to send operands through the parser
	  if they aren't valid Math::Symbolic::* objects.
	- Added and fixed docs. A lot.
	- Added tests.

0.105  Wed Jul  9 18:56:33 2003
	- Added several important items to the TODO.
	- Accepted the fact that the TODO is growing faster than the code base.
	- TODO milestones met with this release:
		+ Add reasonable overloaded interface for arithmetic
		  operators and some mathematical functions as far as feasible.
		+ Overloaded interface for exp, sqrt, log, +,-,*,/,**.
		+ Overloaded interface for boolean context and stringification.
		+ O. i. for unary minus
		+ O. i. for trig functions
		+ Overloaded interface for numerical context.
		+ Tests for the above.
		+ Documentation for the above changes

0.104  Sat Jul  5 19:17:00 2003
	- Added to_sub.pl to the distribution. (Math::Symbolic -> Perl sub
	  compiler.) This is just a proof-of-concept.

0.103  Thu Jun  26 15:08:12 2003
	- Fixed test errors.
	- Added (very little) documentation.

0.102  Wed Jun  25 21:04:41 2003
	- Added overloaded interface for arithmetic operators, exp, log,
	  sqrt, boolean context, numerical context, sin, cos, mutators.
	- Added tests.
	- Added docs.

0.101  Fri Jun  20 15:45:10 2003
	- Documentation fixes

0.100  Fri Jun  20 01:32:32 2003
	(Yep, I hack at random hours.)
	- Implemented hyperbolic sine, h cosine.
	- Implemented partial derivatives for h sine, h cosine
	- Amended parser for h sine, h cosine.
	- Same for tangents
	- Myriad of bugfixes
	- ExportConstants now includes (and exports) PI and EULER constants.
	- Renamed class data in M::S::Operator.
	- Cotangent.
	- Arc sine, arc cosine, arc tangent, arc cotangent.
	- Hyperbolic area sine, h. a. cosine
	- Tests for the above.
	- Broke the parser badly.
	- (much later) Fixed it again.
	- Some more documentation
	- Renamed test files
	- TODO milestones met with this release:
		+ Add sine/cosine
		+ Amend parser to parse sine/cosine.
		+ Add sinh/cosh or at least allow the user to use them in the
		  input string to the parser and have them replaced with
		  (e^x ± e^-x)/2
		+ Amend parser to parse hyperbolic sine/h. cosine.
		+ Add tan, arctan, arcsine, arccosine
		+ Amend parser to parse tan / arctan, arcsine / arccosine.
		+ Find a more reasonable naming scheme for class data and
		  rename appropriately.
		+ Add tests for the new features.
