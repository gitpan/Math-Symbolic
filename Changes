Revision history for Perl extension Math::Symbolic.

0.113  Sun Aug 17 19:13:28 2003
	- Added the MS::Constant pi() constructor
	- Added tests and docs.
	- Added the MS::Base descend() routine. (This is a biggie.)
	- Converted as many descending routines as possible to be using
	  descend() instead of descending themselves.
	  These include is_constant, is_simple_constant, is_sum,
	  apply_constant_fold, apply_derivatives()
	- Added new method namespace to be delegated to M::S::Custom:
	  'contains_.
	- Added docs and tests.
	- Added replace().
	- Fixed a bug in implement(). Now also autoparses strings.
	- Added is_identical() to M::S::C::Default
	- Split up M::S::C::Default into M::S::C::DefaultTests and
	  M::S::C::DefaultMods.
	- Added the M::S::Base::descending_operands() routine that tries to
	  find the most sensible operands to descend into.
	- Added the operand_finder parameter to descend().
	- Moved set_value to M::S::Base and refactored it to use descend().
	- Modified implement() similarily to set_value.
	- Fixed some bugs in implement(), too.
	- Hacked simplify() some more. This needs to be cleaned up real soon.

0.112  Thu Aug  7 19:11:38 2003
	- Continued moving functionality into the M::S::Custom::* namespace.
	- Moved constant_fold into custom namespace
	- Added tests.
	- Fixed serious bugs.

0.111  Tue Jul 29 12:38:40 2003
	- Added Math::Symbolic::Custom::*.
	- Added custom transformation and test functionality.
	- Added is_sum(), is_constant(), is_integer() to M::S::C::Default
	- Added documentation and tests for the above.
	- Moved apply_derivatives() to the MSC::Default namespace.
	- TODO goals met with this release:
		+ Create a Math::Symbolic::Custom class and a
		  Math::Symbolic::Custom::Default class.
		+ The Math::Symbolic::Custom::Default class is to
		  contain all builtin simplification and term-transformation
		  routines.
		  (Also contains methods that tests trees for particular
		  properties)
		+ All calls to Math::Symbolic methods that cannot be
		  resolved in the Math::Symbolic inheritance hierarchy
		  (which should consist of the package itself, anyhow) and
		  that start with "apply_" should be delegated to the subs
		  named apply_... in the Math::Symbolic::Custom
		  package.
		  ('is_', 'test_', and 'mod_' also delegated.)
		+ Math::Symbolic::Custom should load
		  Math::Symbolic::Custom::Default.
		+ Math::Symbolic::Custom::Default should inherit
		  from a package named Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base
		  which defines a special import routine that automatically
		  adds the loaded module to the @ISA of
		  Math::Symbolic::Custom.
		  (Implemented this using a custom exporter scheme.)
		+ Thus, users can extend the number of
		  Math::Symbolic::Custom's by writing a package with
		  transformation subroutines in it that just inherits
		  from Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base. Upon use-ing the
		  custom module, the routines will automatically be
		  added to Math::Symbolic's transformation and testing
		  repertoire.

0.110  Sat Jul 19 15:16:11 2003
	- Documentation patches.
	- Added total derivatives.
	- Fixed the host of bugs that were discovered while implementing
	  total derivatives.
	- Added tests.
	- Added docs.
	- Added docs section on variable passing styles to Compiler.pm
	- Added implement()
	- Fixed uncovered bugs in total derivatives.
	- TODO goals met with this release:
		+ Add signatures to variables.
		+ Add signature() methods to all elements.
		+ Amend parser to parse signatures.
		+ Given the signature-parser enhancements, total derivatives
		  start making sense.
		  Since function signatures must be defined by their signatures
	 	  when they're used, total derivatives can be applied to all
		  functions. (Or, if their implementation is still undefined,
		  they can possibly still be kicked out because of their
		  non-dependence on a particular variable.)
		+ Add tests for sigs.
		+ Add tests for the new features.
