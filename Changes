	- Fixed test errors.
	- Added (very little) documentation.

0.102  Wed Jun  25 21:04:41 2003
	- Added overloaded interface for arithmetic operators, exp, log,
	  sqrt, boolean context, numerical context, sin, cos, mutators.
	- Added tests.
	- Added docs.

0.100  Fri Jun  20 01:32:32 2003
	(Yep, I hack at random hours.)
	- Implemented hyperbolic sine, h cosine.
	- Implemented partial derivatives for h sine, h cosine
	- Amended parser for h sine, h cosine.
	- Same for tangents
	- Myriad of bugfixes
	- ExportConstants now includes (and exports) PI and EULER constants.
	- Renamed class data in M::S::Operator.
	- Cotangent.
	- Arc sine, arc cosine, arc tangent, arc cotangent.
	- Hyperbolic area sine, h. a. cosine
	- Tests for the above.
	- Broke the parser badly.
	- (much later) Fixed it again.
