Math::Symbolic version 0.100
============================

Math::Symbolic is intended to offer symbolic calculation capabilities
to the Perl programmer without using external (and commercial) libraries
and/or applications.

Unless, however, some interested and knowledgable developers turn up to
participate in the development, the library will be severely limited by
my experience in the area. Symbolic calculations are an active field of
research in CS.

Some information on the state of things:
Currently, the interface is weak. Since version 0.08, a parser
for algebraic expressions is integrated into Math::Symbolic. It does not,
however, parse variables at this time. This will be fixed in a future release.

The interface is badly documented. Please refer to the tests and example
programs.
Partial derivatives of logarithms, exponentiations, and arithmetic terms
(*,/,+,- and unary minus as well as variables and constants) work rather
well - albeit slowly. Simplification of algebraic terms is severely limited
at this time.
