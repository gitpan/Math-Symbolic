Math::Symbolic version 0.108
============================

Math::Symbolic is intended to offer symbolic calculation capabilities
to the Perl programmer without using external (and commercial) libraries
and/or applications.

Unless, however, some interested and knowledgable developers turn up to
participate in the development, the library will be severely limited by
my experience in the area. Symbolic calculations are an active field of
research in CS.

Some information on the state of things:
The interface has been improving steadily. Nonetheless, it'll take some more
polishing. Since version 0.08, a parser for algebraic expressions is
integrated into Math::Symbolic. Since version 0.106, the parser also
parses unknown variables.
Since version 0.102, there is an overloaded interface for arithmetic
operators and some overloadable functions and contexts.

The interface is badly documented. Please also refer to the tests and example
programs.

Partial derivatives of logarithms, exponentiations, arithmetic terms
(*,/,+,- and unary minus as well as variables and constants),
trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions,
and area hyperbolic functions work rather well - albeit slowly. Simplification
of algebraic terms is severely limited at this time and its interface will be
significantly refactored in the future.
